AI Firewall Browser Extension Consent\n\nThe browser extension can optionally perform TLS interception (MITM) when configured to do so. This requires installing a local root CA into your OS/browser trust store.\n\nThis repository provides helper scripts and documentation for installing the CA. You MUST obtain explicit consent from users before instructing them to install the CA. The CA installation step is optional—without it the extension will run in non-MITM mode (it will monitor requests it can observe and rely on the proxy configuration).\n\nSee `proxy/tools/ca-manager/README.md` for more details.\n+
