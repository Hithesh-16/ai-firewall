CA Manager

This folder will contain helper scripts to generate a local CA, install and uninstall it in OS keychains.

IMPORTANT: These scripts are optional and MUST be run with explicit user consent. They require admin privileges.

Planned scripts:
- create-ca.sh      # create a new root CA key and cert
- install-ca-macos.sh
- uninstall-ca-macos.sh
- install-ca-windows.ps1
- uninstall-ca-windows.ps1

Do not run these scripts lightly—read the documentation and ensure you understand the risks of installing a root CA on your machine.
